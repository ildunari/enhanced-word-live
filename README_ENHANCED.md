npm install -g @kosta/enhanced-word-mcp-server

# Or using npx (no installation needed)
npx @kosta/enhanced-word-mcp-server
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "enhanced-word-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@kosta/enhanced-word-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 📖 Enhanced Features Documentation

### Enhanced Search & Replace

The enhanced search and replace feature solves the fundamental problem of character positioning that makes the original format_text tool impractical for LLMs.

```python
# Example: Format research terms with semantic targeting
await enhanced_search_and_replace(
    filename="research_paper.docx",
    find_text="polycaprolactone",
    replace_text="polycaprolactone",
    apply_formatting=True,
    bold=True,
    color="green"
)

# Format multiple research terms at once
await format_research_paper_terms("research_paper.docx")
```

**Key Benefits:**
- No character counting required
- Semantic text matching
- Simultaneous replacement and formatting
- Support for regex patterns and whole-word matching
- Academic research terminology helpers

### Review Tools

Perfect for academic collaboration and thesis advisor feedback:

```python
# Extract all comments and track changes
review_summary = await generate_review_summary("thesis_draft.docx")

# Get changes by specific author
author_changes = await get_author_specific_changes("thesis_draft.docx", "Dr. Smith")

# Accept all track changes (create clean version)
await accept_all_changes("thesis_draft.docx")
```

### Section Management

Ideal for organizing large academic documents and thesis synthesis:

```python
# Extract document structure
structure = await extract_sections_by_heading("thesis.docx")

# Extract specific section for analysis
methods_section = await extract_section_content("thesis.docx", "Methods")

# Generate table of contents
await generate_table_of_contents("thesis.docx", max_level=3)

# Merge sections from multiple documents (thesis synthesis)
await merge_sections_from_documents(
    target_filename="combined_research.docx",
    source_files=["paper1.docx", "paper2.docx", "paper3.docx"],
    section_mapping={
        "paper1.docx": "Results",
        "paper2.docx": "Methods",
        "paper3.docx": "Discussion"
    }
)
```

## 🔬 Academic Research Use Cases

### PCL Mesophase Research Example

```python
# Format scientific terminology consistently
await format_specific_words(
    filename="pcl_research.docx",
    word_list=["dolutegravir", "meloxicam", "dexamethasone", "DTG", "MLX", "DEX"],
    bold=True,
    color="blue"
)

# Format statistical notation
await format_specific_words(
    filename="pcl_research.docx", 
    word_list=["p < 0.05", "r²", "±"],
    bold=True,
    color="red"
)

# Extract and combine results sections from multiple student theses
await merge_sections_from_documents(
    target_filename="combined_pcl_results.docx",
    source_files=[
        "mbaye_dolutegravir_thesis.docx",
        "shah_dexamethasone_thesis.docx", 
        "sharan_meloxicam_thesis.docx"
    ],
    section_mapping={
        "mbaye_dolutegravir_thesis.docx": "Results and Discussion",
        "shah_dexamethasone_thesis.docx": "Results and Discussion",
        "sharan_meloxicam_thesis.docx": "Results and Discussion"
    }
)
```

### Thesis Review Workflow

```python
# Generate comprehensive review summary for advisor
review = await generate_review_summary("student_thesis_v3.docx")

# Extract changes by specific reviewer
advisor_feedback = await get_author_specific_changes("student_thesis_v3.docx", "Dr. Johnson")

# After addressing feedback, accept all changes
await accept_all_changes("student_thesis_final.docx")
```
